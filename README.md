# scp-scraper
Node web scraper that uses nightmare to programmatically scrape the contents of scp-wiki.net
At the moment, more of a proof of concept than something intended for large-scale scraping. Can scrape the body, rating, raters (who rated up/down), and discussion posts of any scp

## Instructions
1. Install with `git clone` and `yarn`
2. To scrape SCP-003 (for example) run `node index.js 003`
